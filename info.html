                    <h2> The Round Lute</h2>
                    <p>
                        From Han Dynasty to Tang Dynasty, Chinese lute was in shape of a round body. It is called "pipa"
                        琵琶, a four-stringed musical instrument, belonging to the plucked category of instruments. The
                        pipa is one of the most popular Chinese instruments and has been played for almost two thousand
                        years in many Asian countries. About the origin of pipa, traditional Chinese narrative prefers
                        the story of the Han Chinese princess Liu Xijun sent to marry a barbarian Wusun king during the
                        Han Dynasty, and the pipa was created so she can play music on horseback to soothe her longings.

                    <h2> The Pear-shaped Lute</h2>
                    <p>
                        After the Tang Dynasty, Chinese lute has a pear-shaped wooden body with a varying number of
                        frets ranging from 12 to 26. The pear shaped pipa reached a height of popularity during the Tang
                        Dynasty, and was a principal musical instrument in the imperial court. It may be played as a
                        solo instrument or as part of the imperial orchestra for use in productions such as
                        grand suites, an elaborate music and dance performance.

                <p>This video is about the legend of "Night Parade of One Hundred Demons"(百鬼夜行 - Hyakki Yagyō）. "Every
                    year
                    the demon
                    Nurarihyon, will lead all of the demons through the streets during summer nights." Anyone who
                    comes across the procession would perish or be spirited away by the demons, unless protected by
                    handwritten scrolls by anti-demons spellcasters. It is said that only an Mr Onmyoji clan head is
                    strong enough to pass demon Nurarihyon unharmed.

                    According to the account in the Book Shūgaishō (拾芥抄), a medieval Asia encyclopedia, the only way to
                    be
                    kept safe from the night parade if it were to come by your house is to stay inside on the specific
                    nights associated with the Chinese zodiac or to chant the magic spell.</p>

                    This video is "The 81 Tribulations", which describes the difficulties and tubulences during "The
                    Journey to
                    the West", a
                    Chinese novel published in the 16th century. In this
                    book, monk Xuanzang has been through 81 tribulations he needs to face before attaining Buddhahood in
                    the
                    west. Enduringly popular, the tale is at once a comic adventure story, a humorous satire of Chinese
                    bureaucracy, a spring of spiritual insight, and an extended allegory in which the group of pilgrims
                    journeys
                    towards enlightenment by the power and virtue of cooperation.

                    <h2> The Drums</h2>
                    <p>
                        The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs
                        classification system, it is a membranophone.Drums consist of at least one membrane, called
                        a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the
                        player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound.

                    <h2> The Drums Players</h2>
                    <p>
                        Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such
                        as
                        the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two
                        or
                        more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different
                        drums
                        together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.
